== Objectives

As a Senior Technical Writer on Quarkus documentation, I can offer 4 years of experience that I have gained as the co-author and maintainer of the documentation for Red Hat Cloud-Native Runtimes (formerly designated as Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes).
//I am proficient in writing developer-oriented documentation content for creating Java-based and, to a lesser extent, JavaScript-based applications for deployment in OpenShift and Kubernetes.
//I am also comfortable working with Maven, OpenJDK, CodeReady Studio, Minishift and Container Development Kit/CodeReady Containers and have experience with OpenShift both in the Web Console and using the `oc` (and to a lesser extent ODO) command-line tool.
I have worked as a sole writer and maintainer of a documentation project, and also as part of a team where I collaborate with stakeholders from Customer Content Services and also from other functional areas of Red Hat PnT to make low- and medium-level strategic decisions to develop our documentation according to the current needs of the customers.

//to further improve my knowledge of enterprise Java frameworks for cloud-native application development, focusing on the more recent and emerging technologies that are part of the ecosystem (such as GraalVM and OpenShift 4)
In my new role, I aim to apply my current knowledge to write high-quality documentation content on advanced developer-oriented topics and to collaborate with other writers and stakeholders within and outside of Red Hat Middleware Runtimes to tackle documentation planning and content strategy-related decisions.
I consider the recent shift of strategic focus at Red Hat towards providing managed services for the Open Hybrid Cloud as a particularly interesting challenge to navigate while working on documenting a dynamic and innovative product that Quarkus is.
